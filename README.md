## Ethereum Signed Message Service 

This application was built to be a secure micro-service that accepts requests for TokenClaims & returns a eth_sign, EIP712 compatible payload that can be used to send a token claim to a smart contract that distributes Tokens.  

### Design Goals & Philosophy 

For now, more info on this can be found [in the token-distribution readme here](https://github.com/nopslip/gov-token/blob/master/info/token-distributor.md).
